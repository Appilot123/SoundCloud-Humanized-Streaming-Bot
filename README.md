<h1 align="center">SoundCloud Humanized Streaming Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:

This project is a custom-built SoundCloud streaming bot developed using **Browser Automation Studio** (**BAS**). Its primary goal is to simulate realistic streaming activity across SoundCloud tracks using multiple accounts, while mimicking human behavior to evade detection. It’s designed for users who want to boost stream counts without triggering anti-bot systems—achieved through randomized interactions, fingerprint spoofing, and robust proxy management.

Whether you're running promotions or testing viral loops, this bot gives you the flexibility to scale quietly and effectively.


## Core Features:
- **Advanced Humanization:** Simulates natural behavior with scrolls, play delays, cursor movement, and session variation.
- **IP and Fingerprint Diversity:** Utilizes rotating proxies, user-agent spoofing, and unique device fingerprints for each session.
- **High Scalability:** Easily supports multi-threaded execution with dynamic control over sessions, intervals, and account behavior.
